# Google Reviews Widget – Project Todo Checklist

## Cloudflare Deployment Setup

- [x] **Initial Project Setup** – Set up SvelteKit SaaS Kit boilerplate and repository #infra #frontend
  - [x] Initialize project with SaaS Kit (SvelteKit) and commit to version control #infra #frontend
  - [x] Integrate Tailwind CSS and shadcn-svelte UI components into the project #frontend
  - [x] Configure Supabase connection (URL, service key) for Auth and Database #infra #db
  - [x] Set up Stripe keys and webhooks for billing (using SaaS Kit integration) #infra #security
- [ ] **Cloudflare Pages Deployment** – Deploy the SvelteKit app to Cloudflare Pages #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Create a Cloudflare Pages project and connect the Git repository #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Add environment variables (Supabase keys, Stripe keys, etc.) in Pages settings #infra #cloudflare #security
  - [ ] Configure custom domain (e.g. **googlereviews.app**) for the Pages deployment #infra #cloudflare
- [ ] **Cloudflare Worker & KV Setup** – Prepare backend infrastructure on Cloudflare #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Create a Cloudflare Worker for the reviews API (via Wrangler or Cloudflare Pages Functions) #api #cloudflare
  - [ ] Create a Cloudflare KV namespace for caching Google reviews data #infra #cloudflare #db
  - [ ] Bind the KV namespace to the Cloudflare Worker environment (for read/write access) #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Securely store the Google Places API key in Cloudflare Workers KV or secrets (not exposed publicly) #security #cloudflare
  - [ ] Implement basic KV read/write in the Worker (for testing connectivity) #api #cloudflare #test
- [ ] **Cloudflare R2 (Object Storage)** – Set up media storage for images and backups #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Create a Cloudflare R2 bucket for media (business logos, reviewer avatars, etc.) #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Integrate R2 SDK/API in the app for uploading or retrieving images as needed #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Set appropriate access policies for R2 (private buckets, signed URLs if needed) #security #cloudflare
- [ ] **DNS & CDN Configuration** – Prepare content delivery and network settings #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Ensure DNS records for the custom domain point to Cloudflare Pages (CNAME or A records setup) #infra #cloudflare
  - [ ] Verify HTTPS/SSL is active for the custom domain (Cloudflare auto SSL) #security #cloudflare
  - [ ] Set caching rules if needed for static assets (widget JS) on Cloudflare CDN #performance #cloudflare

## MVP Widget System

- [ ] **Google Reviews API Integration** – Cloudflare Worker to fetch and cache reviews #api #cloudflare
  - [ ] Implement a secure API endpoint (Cloudflare Worker) to retrieve Google Business reviews by Place ID #api #cloudflare
  - [ ] Use the Google Places API (Place Details) within the Worker to fetch review data (server-side) #api #cloudflare
  - [ ] Parse and format the Google API response to a simplified JSON (only necessary fields) #api #cloudflare
  - [ ] Implement caching: on each fetch, store the formatted review data in Cloudflare KV with a TTL #api #db #cloudflare
  - [ ] On subsequent requests, serve data from KV cache if available (to reduce external API calls) #api #db #cloudflare
  - [ ] Apply rate limiting on the Worker endpoint to prevent abuse and stay within Google API quotas #security #cloudflare
  - [ ] Hide the Google API key: ensure all calls go through the Worker (no key in frontend code) #security #api
  - [ ] Return appropriate errors or fallback data if Google API call fails (use cached data if possible) #api #cloudflare
- [ ] **Widget Loader Script** – Develop the client-side widget script for embedding #frontend #api
  - [ ] Create a global `GoogleReviews` JS object with an `init()` method to initialize the widget #frontend
  - [ ] Develop the lightweight widget loader (`widget.js`) that the snippet will load (target <5KB gzipped) #frontend #performance
  - [ ] Implement asynchronous loading: snippet sets `window.__gr` config and loads `widget.js` which auto-inits #frontend
  - [ ] In the widget script, read configuration (widget ID, theme, etc.) from `window.__gr` or data-attributes #frontend
  - [ ] Fetch review data from the Cloudflare Worker API endpoint using the widget’s public API key/ID #frontend #api
  - [ ] Render the reviews on the page in a basic layout (MVP format, e.g. a simple carousel or list) #frontend
  - [ ] Apply basic styles and CSS (using an isolated scope or shadow DOM to avoid conflicts) #frontend
  - [ ] Ensure the widget is responsive (works on various screen sizes) and doesn’t block page load #frontend #performance
  - [ ] Support both installation methods: via JS snippet (window.\_\_gr config) and via HTML attributes on a `div` #frontend
  - [ ] Test the widget script by embedding it on a sample page and verifying reviews load correctly #test #frontend #api
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard (MVP)** – Extend SaaS Kit app for widget management #frontend #db
  - [ ] Implement user authentication flows (leverage Supabase Auth from SaaS Kit for login/signup) #frontend #security
  - [ ] Create a “Business Profile” entity: allow user to add their Google Business Place ID (or search by name) #frontend #db
  - [ ] Save Business Profile data to Supabase (Place ID, business name, address, etc.) #backend #db
  - [ ] Create a “Widget Project” entity for each embeddable widget instance/configuration #frontend #db
  - [ ] Design a form to create a new Widget Project: select a Business Profile and basic settings (e.g. theme, layout choice) #frontend #db #LLM
  - [ ] Generate a unique Widget API Key/ID for each new widget project (for use in embed code) #backend #security
  - [ ] Save widget configuration to database (associate with user account and business profile) #backend #db
  - [ ] Display the embed code (JavaScript snippet and/or `<div>` code with data-attributes) for the user to copy #frontend
  - [ ] List all existing widgets the user has created, with basic info (name, site, etc.) #frontend #db
  - [ ] Implement view for each widget project to preview how it will look (simple live preview using the actual widget script) #frontend
  - [ ] Show usage statistics for each widget (e.g. views this month) on the dashboard main page #frontend #db
  - [ ] Integrate Stripe billing UI if needed for upgrading plans (or link to Stripe Customer Portal) #frontend #api
- [ ] **Basic Analytics & Quotas** – Initial tracking of widget usage and simple analytics #api #db
  - [ ] Log each widget load event in the database or analytics service (widget ID, timestamp, etc.) #api #db
  - [ ] Set up a daily job or function to aggregate usage per widget per day (e.g. store daily counts in Supabase) #db #infra
  - [ ] Display simple analytics in dashboard: e.g. total views this month vs allowed quota, average rating of reviews #frontend #db
  - [ ] Enforce basic quotas: if a widget exceeds its plan’s view limit, flag it or temporarily disable loading #security #db
  - [ ] Add an in-widget notice or fallback (e.g. “Upgrade required” banner) if free tier quota is exceeded #frontend #security
  - [ ] Ensure the free tier widgets show the “Powered by GoogleReviews (YourBrand)” branding on the widget #frontend
  - [ ] Hide or remove branding for paid tier widgets (no branding for Basic and above plans) #frontend
  - [ ] Verify that analytics tracking does not noticeably slow down the widget load (use asynchronous logging) #performance #test
